# scanner.java - Deprecated

Simple Java implementation of a scanner for the OSSKB (Open Source KB).

** Deprecated **

This project is not actively maintained.

For an up-to-date API/SDK see the [SCANOSS Java Library](https://github.com/scanoss/scanoss.java) or the [Python CLI](https://github.com/scanoss/scanoss.py).

# Usage
The code can be used as a library, or as a CLI.

## Standalone
A jar with dependencies is generated by Maven Assembly plugin using `mvn package`.

Usage:
```% java -jar target/scanner-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar
usage: scanner
 -blacklist <arg>    Scan and blacklist components in SBOM file
 -f,--format <arg>   Optional format for the scan result. One of: plain,
                     spdx, cyclonedx
 -h                  Shows usage
 -identify <arg>     Scan and identify components in SBOM file
 -ignore <arg>       Scan and ignore components in SBOM file
 -o,--output <arg>   Save output to file
 ```

## Maven library
To build the code please run:
```
mvn clean package
```
And to test run:
```
java -jar target/scanner-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
To publish please run:
```
mvn deploy -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

It should then be possible to find it on [Maven Central](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~com.scanoss).

If the staging environment is used, then details for releasing it can be found [here](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/release/).

# How does it work
This reference code illustrates the usage of the SCANOSS API to obtain file identification against the OSSKB without sending the actual code, but instead the WFP hashes

The provided FILE is read into memory, WFP fingerprints are calculated and sent to the [OSSKB API](https://osskb.org) 

Results are printed via STDOUT.
