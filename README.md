## Maven library

# How does it work

This reference code illustrates the usage of the SCANOSS API to obtain file identification against the OSSKB without sending the actual code, but instead the WFP hashes

The provided FILE is read into memory, WFP fingerprints are calculated and sent to the [OSSKB API](https://osskb.org) 

Results are printed via STDOUT.
